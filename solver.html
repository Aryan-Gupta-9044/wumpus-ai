    <h2>AI Solution Path</h2>
    
    <p>
        The AI solver for Wumpus World uses knowledge-based reasoning to navigate the world safely.
        It keeps track of what it knows and what it can infer based on its percepts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How the AI Reasons:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The AI maintains a knowledge base of what it knows about each cell in the grid.</li>
        <li>When it perceives a breeze, it knows that at least one adjacent cell contains a pit.</li>
        <li>When it perceives a stench, it knows that at least one adjacent cell contains the Wumpus.</li>
        <li>As it explores, it updates its knowledge and infers which cells are safe to visit.</li>
        <li>It uses a search algorithm to find an optimal path to the gold while avoiding dangers.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Logical Reasoning Example:</h3>
    <p>
        If the AI is at position (1,1) and perceives no breeze and no stench, it can infer that:
        <ul>
            <li>All adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) are safe from both pits and the Wumpus.</li>
            <li>This information is added to the knowledge base.</li>
            <li>The AI can now safely move to any of these cells without risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If the AI then moves to (1,2) and perceives a breeze but no stench, it can infer that:
        <ul>
            <li>At least one of the adjacent cells (0,2), (1,3), (2,2) contains a pit.</li>
            <li>It knows (1,1) is safe (it just came from there).</li>
            <li>It will update its knowledge base with this information.</li>
            <li>The AI will avoid unproven cells until it has more information.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Through this logical reasoning process, the AI can navigate the Wumpus World safely
        and efficiently to find the gold.
